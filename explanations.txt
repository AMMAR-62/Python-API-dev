needs of virtual environments?
project 1 -> fast api v1.2.1
new project 2 -> fast api v2.4.3
upgrade fast api
this may be a problem, if the fast api version is not compatible with other project
the projects need different versions
isolated environments, virtual environments.

==============================================

interpreter in the virtual environment needs to be used so we change the interpreter

==============================================
why we need a schema:
 - it's a pain to get all the values from the body.
 - the client can send whatever data they want.
 - the data isn't getting validated.
 - we ultimately want to force the client to send data in a schema that we expect.
 - the pydantic is used for defining the schema.
 - we use the pydantic models which are the similar to the mongoose models in the MERN stack.
 - pydantic models can be converted to the dictionary by using the .dict() method.

==============================================
CRUD - create, read, update, delete - four main functions of the api.
create - post.
read - get
update - put/patch
delete - delete

 - we always use the plurals, it's the convention.
 - like /posts, /posts/:id, /posts, etc.
 - we use the curly braces for the argument like {id}
 - patch - for specific field.
 - put - all of the same information, and change the field we need.
